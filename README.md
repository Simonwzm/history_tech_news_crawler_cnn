# history_tech_news_crawler_cnn

This is a crawler for cnn's history tech news.

The project utilizes web.archieve.org's service to trackback finding history pages of cnn.com/business/tech, thus to fetch history tech news articles

The project then leverages module `newspaper3k` to parse the articles and save the meta data to local storage, serving a data base for  future indexing and search engine project.

The project is already a submodule of our search engine project "SJTUEE208_WWCS", you can learn more about us in our repo `https://github.com/shixiangsong/SJTUEE208_WWCS`

Currently the project hasn't perpared for open source uses. If you want to utilize this project, please contact me (emailï¼‰
